This mod allows you to rename and dye items.
To begin, craft the Item Customizer at an anvil
with 5 iron/lead and one Strange Plant.

Use the "Item Customizer" to access the UI.
Put an item in the right slot, and 
a dye in the left if you want to dye the item.
Type in the text box if you want to change the item's name.

When you're done, click the "Apply" button, and remove the item(s).
Or leave them in there, I don't care.

Enjoy!

Additional features:
- Dye ammo for it to be dyed separately from your bow/gun/rocket launcher!
- Dye equipment to save dyes directly onto your favorite vanities!
- Dye anything for it to look cool in your inventory!

Latest Update (2.2.0):
- The Anti-Netcode Update
- Refactors netcode to be less stupid by removing netcode, not even kidding
- Even more wrong projectile shading fixes
- Finally fixes the infinite knockback bug
