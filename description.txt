This mod allows you to rename and dye items.
To begin, craft the Item Customizer at an anvil
with 5 iron/lead and one Strange Plant.

Place the tile then right-click it to access the GUI.
Put an item in the left slot, and 
a dye in the right if you want to dye the item.
Type in the text box if you want to change the item's name.

When you're done, click the "Apply" button, and remove the item(s).

Enjoy!
